# APCS2 Final Project
## Group Info
Period 5 <br />
Ronnie Woo & Filippos Kogiantis <br />
Group Name: T-spin Triple Tower <br />
## Overview
Project Description: We created the classic puzzle game Tetris in Processing. We prioritized making the default single-player game mode with basic features. The game displays properly, and pieces automatically spawn and fall. Pieces can also be moved left and right, rotated, or softdropped/harddropped. Pieces can also be held, and there are ghost (preview) pieces that display on the board. If we get the base game working early, we can implement more complex features like t-spins, combos, and a 1v1 mode.
## Instructions
The game runs automatically in Processing.

Left - move piece left <br />
Right - move piece right <br />
Down - soft drop <br />
Up - hard drop <br />
C - rotate clockwise <br />
X - rotate counterclockwise <br />
Shift - hold piece <br />

## Major Bugs
1. There is a small chance that holding a piece will cause the game to crash.
2. Our game can't take multiple inputs at once. Holding several keys at the same time often causes unintentional actions. Because of this, you can only press/hold one key at a time.
